          <strong>Mr. XYZ</strong> is dummy person from <em>Jaisalmer, Rajasthan</em>. Born in Gujrat, he has lived in Bamgalore but recently returned to his homecountry to travel. He loves walking around hidden backstreets discovering quirky shops and random art.

          I love wandering through the streets of Jaisalmer, finding new places popping up at every corner. The city is constantly reinventing itself which was one of the reason I came back to my home city after many years. When asked about my experience, I can only respond:
        </p>
        <blockquote>Jaisalmer is the city of my dreams: This unique living urban centre, formerly an ancient fort, is home to over 3000 people with shops, people and cows in honeycombed old houses on criss-crossing lanes. Walk past temples and shops and stop for a cup of masala chai on a rooftop restaurant for spectacular panoramic views. Perfectly shaded yellow sandstone walls take you back to a time of battles and reinforcements here.</blockquote>
        <p>
          Get friendly with a local family in Jaisalmer,getting to know more about their traditions and culture, as they give you a quick MasterChef session on Rajasthani food. Dishes could vary, depending on the season you’re visiting in, from millet flatbread (bajreki roti), legumes (fali) and stuffed pepper (mirchibada) to lentil-infused hard wheat rolls (daalbaati). Enjoy your very own home-cooked Rajasthani meal with the family and don’t forget to take notes.

          I hope that more and more people will see the true beauty of Jaisalmer soon. It is a captivating beast that you won't be able to take your eyes of again. Explore the city in your own pace and <u>discover things you have never seen before</u>.
